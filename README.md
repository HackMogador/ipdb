# Abusive IP And ASN Networks Database
We have compiled a block list consisting of abusive IP addresses and ASN networks that have shown a troubling tendency to permit their services to be exploited for malicious purposes, with seemingly little concern for the consequences of their actions.

The block list includes IPs and ASNs that have been found to be involved in activities such as spamming, hacking, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, phishing, and other cybercrimes. These entities have demonstrated a lack of responsible oversight and have allowed their infrastructures to be utilized as tools for abuse without taking sufficient measures to prevent such misuse.

Our aim in creating this block list is to safeguard against potential threats and protect our networks and systems from harm. By implementing these restrictions, we hope to curtail the ability of malicious actors to carry out their harmful activities and promote a safer online environment for all users.

It is essential to remain vigilant and proactive in addressing abusive behavior on the internet, and this block list serves as a measure to counteract the exploitation of services for harmful purposes. We encourage other organizations and network administrators to take similar actions to protect their own infrastructure and prevent potential damage from these abusive IPs and ASN networks.

In conclusion, we take the matter of cyber abuse seriously and strive to mitigate its impact on our systems and the wider online community. By working together and sharing responsibility for maintaining a secure online space, we can collectively address and discourage abusive activities and foster a more positive digital landscape.
